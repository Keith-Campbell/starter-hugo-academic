Atsushi Hori is a Ph.D. student at Kyoto University. I am interested in mathematical optimization and particularly working variational inequalities and Nash equilibrium problems under uncertainty.
My current supervisor is Professor Nobuo Yamashita, and the previous supervisor (when I was in Nanzan University) is Professor Masao Fukushima who is a professor emeritus at Kyoto University.
